# MARL re-implementation.

I use [Clement Gehring's implementation of tile coding](https://github.com/gehring/tilecoding) -- when you install submodules via git, this should come included.

These all target python2, since we're stuck with what mininet can offer.

also:

```sh
touch tilecoding/__init__.py
```
