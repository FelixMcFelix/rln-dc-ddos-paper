It includes architectural concepts, principles, and components used in the construction of composite services through deployment of SFCs, with a focus on those to be standardized in the IETF. This document does not propose solutions, protocols, or extensions to existing protocols.},

	abstract =	{This document describes a Network Service Header (NSH) imposed on packets or frames to realize service function paths. The NSH also provides a mechanism for metadata exchange along the instantiated service paths. The NSH is the SFC encapsulation required to support the Service Function Chaining (SFC) architecture (defined in RFC7665).},
